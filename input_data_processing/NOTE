TEST1
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and required_genes only for both training and predicting
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
TEST2
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and all genes for both training and predicting
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
TEST3
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and all genes for both training and predicting
 * Use the same blacklist as eBIC - selected_genes <- intersect of genes in expression and network
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
 - for robustness test using 3 random seed(111, 123, 1234)
TEST4
 - Used JASPAR instead of STRING for training and predicting
 - Refactored scripts
 - Used TMM method for normalization
 - Made a change to the method for pseudobulking. Previously, the method randomly selected 150 cells out of a total of N cells, resulting in the exclusion of the remaining N-150 cells. Now we generate multiple replicates and use the median valude from the replicates.
TEST5
 - Used JASPAR for training and STRING for predicting
TEST6
 - Used STRING edges overlapped with JASPAR
TEST7
 - TEST3 with Refactored scripts
TEST14
 - /home/seongwonhwang/Desktop/projects/git/GRN_inference_practice/input_data_processing/data/bulk_anonymize
TEST15
 - dermal.fibroblast_iPSC
 - Used all TFs and genes for predicting
 - v2 - use all possible edges for prediction
 - v3 - use GENIE3 network (cutoff - upper quantile 30)
 - v4 - use GENIE3 network (cutoff - upper quantile 20) + STRING
 - v5 - use STRING
TEST16
 - dermal.fibroblast_myoblast
 - v4 - use GENIE3 network (cutoff - upper quantile 20) + STRING
